# Comparing-Different-Pathfinding-Algorithms

## What is Path finding?

**Path finding** in applications is the research of finding the shortest and/or cheapest (optimal) route between 2 points, usually on graphs. To achieve this, many different algorithms are used, all having better performance in certain situations. These are heavily based on **Dijkstra's algorithm**, which is an algorithm Created by **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in 1956 to find the shortest path between 2 **nodes** on a graph. This algorithm gets used in, for example, modern GPS systems to find the shortest path to get to your destination. In this Research project, I used the framework provided by my college (**DAE Howest**) to compare 2 well known path finding algorithms, and 1 lesser known algorithm that is a variant on 1 of these 2, to find the most optimal one. These algorithms being:
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* A Star (A*)
* Jump Point Search (JPS)
